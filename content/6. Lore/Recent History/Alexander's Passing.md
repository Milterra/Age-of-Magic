Everything fades to white, and you find yourselves facing a majestic sunset. Before you is an endless expanse of water perfectly reflecting the twilight sky, the sun exactly halfway down the horizon such that its reflection on the water forms the circle whole. The sky blazes orange outwards from the star and as your gaze sweeps across the sky you see it bleed into purple, into blue, and then racing into the endless, starry night behind. Walking around you see the water ripple, and yet it doesn't travel as far as you'd expect, instead quickly sinking back into the reflective sheen of still water. 

Strangely, you feel a sense of calm and nostalgia, despite the dangers you faced just moments before. The adrenaline is gone in your veins, as if it wasn't there at all, and your sweat evaporated along with your exhaustion and pain. Instead, a sort of peace settles down upon you, making you wonder if this is the afterlife. 

But no, across the expanse, to the right of the ethereal sunset, is a man in armor, kneeling in front of a woman. It is the monster you fought just now, though his armor now shines pristine, lacking the cracks and rust that permeated it before. The helm is gone, revealing a mop of blonde hair and a handsome but solemn face. 

The woman is beautiful, so much so that you all collectively catch your breaths. You cannot quite tell what race she is, nor even if you are all seeing the same woman, but you are sure that she must be the goddess of beauty. She is wearing a loose dress, in a style unlike anything you have seen before. It seems ancient, and yet fashionable, as if certain motifs have been passed down through the ages and incorporated into modern fashion. 

The woman speaks gently to the man, though you can all hear her voice as if she was beside you, whispering in a sweet voice. "Alexander, I am ever proud of thee. Thou hast fulfilled thy duty with admirable determination, even when thy very corpse has been desecrated by thine enemy." 

"Have I done enough, dear goddess? Will **this** be enough?" The man says, his voice soft but strong, the voice of a man who could command entire kingdoms. 

"The war rages ever onwards, though the passage of millennia wears upon the land. Yet, thy sacrifice has not been in vain. Even now, thy allies rally for the coming storm, for thou hast given them hope, and time to prepare." 

Tears fall down Alexander's eyes, and a sob escapes him. "It was horrible, her grip upon my soul. I had thought myself unworthy for falling so quickly to her attacks. I thought the world had fallen because of my weakness." His body trembles and the goddess kneels beside him, taking him into an embrace. It's a surreal sight for you all, a hero of legend being comforted by a goddess. 

"Thou has failed no one. Rest now, dear hero, the watcher at the rim. Be at peace." Alexander's body is enveloped in a soft, white glow, until he is nothing more than a faint outline in the goddess' arms. And then, the light breaks off into a hundred motes of light that float up towards the night sky and into the great beyond. 

The goddess' regarded the trail of lights for a while before she looks towards you all, acknowledging your presence for the first time. 

"I can see in thine eyes a hunger for answers," she says, "but I fear thou shalt be disappointed. I am bound by a pact of non-interference, and can only bring to my realm those who stand at the precipice of their destiny. A... crossroads, if you will. Only Alexander was supposed to transition here, and yet ye all were brought forth. How auspicious. Perhaps a great destiny is written in thine own stars. Fare thee well, I expect our paths will cross again." 

The goddess waves her hand and you are taken by that same white light that eventually fades, revealing the tomb of Alexander.
