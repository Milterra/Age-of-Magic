### **Odel** 
#### 13th day of Sheen, 3021 Years After the Fall

It was bedtime for Odel Weber, but he was not in the mood for sleep. He ran across the house with his father chasing behind him, laughing all the while. Ada, his mother, smiled with amusement from the stairway as his two boys played tag along the furniture and the doorways, up the stairs and into the balcony, until finally Isidor managed to trap his son in the bathroom. Odel frantically searched for an escape and, seeing the space between his father’s legs, suddenly sprang into action, whereupon he was caught in his dad’s embrace, lifted, and punished with a barrage of kisses.

“Stop it,” Odel said, laughing all the while. “It tickles!”

“Caught you again, my young runner,” Isidor said, carrying Odel to his room.

“I don’t want to sleep yet!”

“Now, now. What did I tell you about kids who stay up past their bedtime?”

“The Shadowfiend isn’t real,” Odel said, pouting.

“Would you want to find out the hard way,” his father said, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “They say that the Shadowfiend eats children from the feet first, so that the child can watch in horror as he chews their legs. Like this!” Isidor began to tickle the soles of Odel’s feet, and they both laughed in earnest as the young boy gave up and agreed to get into bed.

Just as Odel settled into his sheets, he said, “Dad, why don’t Centorians have magic?”

Isidor’s hands stopped short of turning off the bedside lamp. “Where did you hear that?”

“I heard it from one of my friends at school,” Odel said. “He says that only we can do magic, but outsiders can’t. Why is that?”

“Well, nobody knows. But, there are stories,” He said mysteriously.

Odel’s eyes widened with curiosity. “Tell me, tell me!”

Isidor smiled. “Do you promise to sleep afterwards?”

“Promise, promise, promise!”

“Alright.” Isidor pulled over a chair and, in his deep, calming voice, began. “Long ago, long before our magic, the goddess Metria gave birth to twins, and she named them Rysiel and Therok. Now, gods and goddesses don’t grow up like we do, and the twins were born as big as an adult and as wise as an old man.”

Odel frowned. “How does that work?”

“I don’t know,” Isidor admitted. “But that’s how the story goes. In any case, Metria made the world as a gift to her children, and they both enjoyed the pleasures of the earth. Rysiel made the plants, the trees, the vines and the mosses. Therok made the animals, the fishes, the cows and the birds. In their harmony they created life as we know it today, but still there were no humans, for only Metria could create creatures that think!

“The twins enjoyed the world for a long time. They climbed the icy mountains and swam through the deepest oceans. They ran with the horses across plains and flew with the birds as they migrated. It was a peaceful time, or so they say, but no peace lasts forever.

“Rysiel became bored with the world, and asked Mother Metria to make something that looked like them, that could think like them, but was not as powerful as them. In her love, Mother Metria failed to see Rysiel’s inner desire to rule, and so she made humans, tasking the twins to guide them into civilization. This tired Mother Metria, and she slept for a long time.”

“What does ‘civilization’ mean,” Odel asked.

“It’s a difficult word, but for now think of it as the ability to speak and make cities. To have their own traditions and stories. Do you understand?”

“I think,” Odel said, eyebrows furrowing in deep thought.

“Now the humans were weak and frail, and did not have the magic that the gods have. So Rysiel and Therok became their guardians and rulers, making sure that they survived and prospered. They taught humans how to grow crops and tame animals for food. They taught humans how to make tools and machines to better help in everyday activities. They taught humans how to brew medicine and heal wounds so that they don’t die easily.

“And so the humans grew into great numbers, and there came a time when the humans wanted to leave their home and explore more of the land. Therok granted them their request and wished them luck on their journey, and so they went to the farthest reaches of the world and made their own homes there. But little did he know that Rysiel hated this decision They fought and argued for days, exchanging angry words and gestures, until it came to a point of no return. Rysiel struck Therok in anger, and in her guilt she fled!

“Rysiel took with her a great number of loyal humans and left their home. She settled on another place and drew a magical line on the ground.

“ ‘Do not cross this line, dear Brother, for it is my land and your people are not welcome here!’ she said. And so the first kingdoms were born, both ruled by gods.

“At first Rysiel stayed put in her own kingdom, caring for her own people, demanding worship and offerings. But soon enough, the desire to rule became too strong, and she wanted Therok’s people too! She taught her people the ways of war, taught them how to make swords and bows, catapults and cannons, and made them march towards Therok’s kingdom.

Now Therok knew about this too, and he reluctantly taught his people the same, for they cannot defend themselves with pitchforks and plows. They made castles and barricades to protect themselves against the might of Rysiel’s army. And so the War of Heaven came to pass. Stories say it lasted a thousand years, killing over a million people, turning the land red and barren from the blood of the soldiers.

Odel’s eyes were rapt with attention, and he unconsciously leaned in close. “Did it ever end?”

Isidor smiled, but it was a sad smile. “It ended in what we now call the Fall. At the end of the war, Therok became weary and tired, and wanted to end all the suffering of the humans. So he challenged Rysiel to a duel, knowing fully well that his sister was more capable in combat than he. They met at their ancestral home, now the center of Therok’s kingdom, and their battle lasted for days. Divine light sparked across the land with each strike of their swords. Every blow sent volcanoes erupting, and every cut caused the earth to shake and open up. Dark angry clouds swirled around them, for they fought in the sky, and every stroke sent lightning crashing to the ground. On the 6th day, Rysiel, seeing her brother weary and wounded, rushed in for the final strike and stabbed Therok through the chest!

“No,” Odel gasped.

“The earth shook as never before, the oceans raged in storm, and tornadoes swept across the land in mourning of their fallen master. Therok’s body glowed a bright red, and with his final breath he wished that all his people would be safe. And so it was that as the fallen god’s body crashed onto the ground, it sent a shockwave of magic that filled the land, granting power to all that were loyal to him. So the story goes of how our Milterran ancestors became magicians, while everyone that was born outside of our blood and our land were magic-less.”

Odel teared up, “But that’s unfair! It’s all Rysiel’s fault!”

Isidor gave a comforting pat on his son’s head and said, “It’s just a story, dear boy.”

“How does the story end,” Odel asked, beginning to calm down.

“Well, there are many versions as there are many storytellers. My personal favorite is this: that Mother Metria, awakened by the death of her son, was so angry that she cursed Rysiel to forever grant life to unborn humans, but that Rysiel could never rule nor interact with humans again. In fact, she forbade all other gods and goddesses from ever setting foot in the world, to prevent another tragedy such as this. As for Therok, the Mother visited her son in the world of the dead, and made him ruler there. All creatures that die find their way to Therok’s domain, and in there he will care for them as he had done when he was alive.”

Odel was silent for a long time, even after his father bade him good night and turned off the lamp. He thought and thought about the story that his father told him, imagined scenes and possibilities in the story. In his sleep, he dreamed of being a soldier in the long war, of watching the red skies flicker and flare in the titanic battle of the gods. It was a story that he would always remember, a memory he looked back to whenever he missed his father.
