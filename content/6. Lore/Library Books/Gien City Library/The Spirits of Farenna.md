The book seems to be a short story about two lovers fighting together as soldiers in a war. It is quick, fantastical, and features a fictional magic system where every person is born with a spirit twin that they must befriend in order to use their magic. You quickly flip through the pages detailing their romance, their struggles, and their triumph. In the climax, after a particularly tragic reveal, you flip to the next chapter and see the corner of the page folded. Written on the fold in an elegant script is, "**For Rhyne**".

## Chapter 46: Violin

_Clack, clack, clack, clack._

The sound of my heels on the tiled floor echoes throughout the hallway, drowning the thoughts that threaten to swallow me.

_Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack._

People pass me by, officers and soldiers in uniform, but I barely notice them. They know what happened, and so they part as I walk through the hallway towards my room. My face is impassive, but they all know it’s a mask, and that a tempest is swirling beneath.

_CLACK, CLACK, CLA-_

I stumble as the left heel of my shoe broke. A soldier nearby falters, locked in an inner conflict deciding whether it is better for his well-being to help me up or to get out of my sight. He chooses the latter, stumbling and fumbling and muttering apologies.

Good choice. That soldier just avoided a week in the infirmary.

I remove my boots and hurl them at a wall.

_Cresentia,_ I call to the being inside me, _burn them!_

My body glows amber red and the boots ignite, instantly bursting to ashes and dust. The scent of burnt leather begins to reach my nose, and I stand up to walk away from the unpleasant smell.

Cresentia stays silent, and I don’t know whether to be grateful or angry at this irregular display.

I reach the door to my room barefoot and very nearly broke down. His scent, though faint, lingers by the doorway, reminding me over and over again of the pain.

The first thing I destroy is the façade of my room. The door is a metal panel that slides between the walls, the same blue color of my uniform, and they both rip off under the might of my magic.

Then follows a series of wooden furniture unlucky enough to be placed near the entrance.

Going deeper into the room, I see the familiar living room dominating the center, the same kitchen to my right, the door leading to the bedroom at the far end, and the bathroom to my left. It is cramped and minimal, much as one would expect from a military base, but being a high-ranking officer, I have the privilege of bringing many of my personal belongings. I contemplate which one I should break next.

Directly in front of me is the burgundy couch that we bought in Thassaleir, the famed city of commerce. I remember us fighting over the color of the thing, him lobbying for the dark red and me for the royal blue.

“This is, most assuredly, the perfect color for us,” he explained. Then he dropped a bomb in the form of a whisper. “It is exactly the color of your face when we tumble in bed.”

I blushed to his laughter. “See! Madam Proprietress,” he said, turning to the owner, “behold her elegantly enflamed cheeks. Does it not match the hue of this couch?”

What else could I say, then?

The flash of memory carries with it a blade, and it strikes me true through the chest. I never thought one could experience both joy and sorrow at the same time.

Fury, fear, passion, hatred… I cannot name exactly what I’m feeling, but it moves my body and erases my thoughts. I stride through the room, scorching the couch and obliterating the table set in front of it. Plates smash against the walls and chairs break down into splinters. Books fly out of their shelves and rip themselves to pieces. Cresentia has surrendered her magic to me, and I am hell incarnate.

“Luna.” His voice whispers, and I turn around, surprised.

Empty. Chunks of burning wood litter the floor and remnants of broken furniture lie scattered around, but the room is cold and empty.

I must be going crazy.

But how I long to hear his voice again. To hear my name being uttered by his deep voice. To hear once more his song accompanying my instrument.

Say something, please...

Out of frustration, I lash out at the nearest wall with an empowered punch, sending a tremor coursing throughout the compound.

Running out of plates to break, I turn to the cabinets that once housed them. I release Cresentia out of my body and order her to rip off the cabinets from their bolts. She does as I command, a spirit in my image hovering towards the kitchen and effortlessly removing them off the walls with her magic, but her face – our face – reflects pity and sadness.

Cresentia asks that I return her inside, and I was nearly brought back to my senses by the extremely uncharacteristic request. Nearly, until I realized why. I grieve, and so must she. Although her face mirrors mine, her personality does not. To her, pain is a poison to swallow, while to me, pain is a weapon to wield. And so I destroy and destroy and destroy until the kitchen is reduced to a heap of charred metal and broken glass.

My rage extends to the wall separating the living room and the bedroom, the metal panel and door crumpling like paper and revealing the simple bedroom beyond.

A bed, a wardrobe, a nightstand, and upon its own glass case mounted on the wall, a violin. My most precious treasure.

Elegantly carved and varnished, the violin was a masterpiece from the artificers of Eulyka, city of craft. He gave it to me on the night of my promotion to Captain.

A cloudless night it was, and the moons were nowhere to be seen. He dragged me to a nearby hilltop and there, away from the light of the camp, the stars shone like never that I’ve seen before. The sky was a canvas of boundless black and blue, and upon it glimmered spilled paint of twinkling white and yellow.

Hidden among a nearby pile of rocks was a small chest, and from it he conjured the violin and bow.

“Congratulations, my Captain,” he said, and tears flowed down my cheeks as I saw the mark of Eulyka on the back of the instrument. It would take half a decade to pay off with a soldier’s wages, but the workmanship of the city of craft was legendary.

That night I played the violin while he sang along, and we were the happiest couple in the world.

*Were*.

Uncontrollable tears stream down my face as the song plays in my mind over and over again. I scream out in anger and begin to destroy the bedroom one by one.

The bedframe explodes, engulfing the mattress in a fiery blaze.

**Are you going to Scarborough Fair?** His song echoes inside my head and a fresh wave of sobbing takes control of my body.

The wardrobe quickly catches on fire, and the air is filled with the smell of burnt cotton and leather.

**Yesterday holds memories in time**, Stop it stop it stop it! This isn’t real! He's not *dead*!

The nightstand is thrown at impossible speeds by Cresentia’s magic, and it breaks into a million pieces upon crashing onto the wall.

**Remember me to the one who lives there** Please… oh god please… I’d give anything…

I storm towards the violin and shatter the glass case with my bare hands. Fresh blood smears onto the wood as I grip the neck and pain shoots up my arm as strings bite into new wounds, but I don’t feel them. I don’t feel anything. I feel so empty and it scares me so much that I raise the violin and swing it towards the floor.

But I can’t.

**She once was a true love of mine**

My body stops mid-swing, glowing red and frozen in time. Silence fills the rooms and I try to struggle, but my efforts are all in vain as magic locks my body in place.

“Cresentia, release me!” I screech, finding strength to move my mouth.

"No, Luna", she finally speaks, a whisper in my mind, and I hate her for it.

“Let me go!” My voice raises an octave. “Cresentia!”

"Don’t do something you’ll soon regret", she says, and I lose strength as the weight of my emotions comes crashing down inside me.

I begin to wail, an unrestrained cry of raw grief that comes flooding out of my heart. Cresentia finally releases me from her magic, and I fall onto the floor cradling the violin close to my chest.

My teardrops endlessly overflow onto the varnished wood, materializing everything that I’ve yet to say, and everything that’s already been said; every moment yet to happen, and every moment already past; every place we’ve yet to visit, and every place we’ve already gone; every vow we’ve yet to make, and every vow we’ve already made.

I sit surrounded by the embers and ashes of our memories, and in one final, desperate plea, I cry out his name.

“Sol, please come back to me.”

 The chapter ends halfway into the page, and you see on the blank half a letter left by Lina. There are circular marks on the page where droplets of water fell and dried, so painfully fresh.
 
 
 > My Dearest Rhyne,
 > 
 >I once believed this tale to be full of fanciful delusions, a thing of excessive emotion and folly, cherished by foolish teens from Noria—those who have yet to learn the weight of life’s realities. But since I met you, I've started to think that, maybe, the story was not so meaningless after all. Perhaps I was the fool, unwilling to look beyond the illusion and discover what's truly important.
 >
 >You burst into my life like the rising sun after a cold winter's night. In you I found a kindred soul who understands those quiet parts of me that I scarcely show the world. Though our time together was short, know that my feelings for you are not the fleeting flames of youthful fancy, but the unyielding fire of a hearth well-tended, giving warmth even in the coldest of hours. To be away from you is a deep pain such that I have never known, and I found that the world has lost its color in the dawn of our parting.
 >
 >Rhyne, this cannot be our last farewell. I will not have it! Promise me that you will stay alive. Though we're miles apart, know that you will never stray far from my thoughts. Should you need aid, present my heirloom to any Verena office in Milterra and they will help you as best they can. Send word to me and I will come, or send someone who can help.

>Let's meet again under the silent light of the library halls. _Hindi ako bumati sa simula upang sa huli ay magpaalam._

>With all my heart,
>
>Lina
