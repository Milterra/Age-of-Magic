**Winston the Bard**
Hush now, my dear, don't let them hear  
Quiet footsteps in the night,  
Turn to slumber, hold your temper  
Don't let the kobolds hear your fright  

**Chorus**
Look to the sky, answer my call 
Brandish your weapons and fight 
Look to yourself, steel your resolve 
Hope and courage, banish the night 

[**Aspen**](../../1.%20Players/Aspen%20Grover.md)
The farmer's fields are up in flames 
The blacksmith's son, lost to the wild 
The mayor's guards, slaughtered like game 
Every fam'ly, missing a child 

**Chorus**

[**Jimbo**](../../1.%20Players/Jimbo%20Swaggins.md)
Alleys and streets, death and decay 
Castles and temples so hallow 
Saints and sinners, all rue the day 
Grand cities lost to the shadow 

**Chorus**

[**Krispy**](../../1.%20Players/Krispy%20Drea.md)
In shattered dreams and whispered woe,  
The wounds are silent, deep and wide.  
A soul once pure, now broken low,  
A monster slumbers deep inside

**Chorus**

[**Naill**](../../1.%20Players/Arannis%20Naillo%20(Naill).md)
In chains I dream of skies so wide
Where freedom’s song can touch each soul
Though bound in sorrow, I’ll still strive
To break these walls and make us whole

**Chorus**

[**Qimir**](../../1.%20Players/Qimir.md)
Her voice once filled the fields with song,  
Now silence haunts the path we tread.  
A brother's heart, forever wronged,  
She’s gone, and all that's left is dread.

**Chorus**

[**Rhyne**](../../1.%20Players/Rhyne.md)
In twilight’s glow, the wizards stand,  
Their spells cast long into the night.  
With ancient lore and magic grand,  
They seek the dawn, to end the fight.

**Chorus**

[**Grymmoire**](../../1.%20Players/Grymmoire.md)
Through storms that rage, and shadows fall,  
you are the strength that conquers all.  
The road is long, the path is steep,  
but dreams are sown where courage leaps.

**Chorus**

[**Iivanna**](../../1.%20Players/Iivanna%20Phyrdin.md)
The gutter’s home, the hunger’s deep,  
We beg for scraps, we hide from blows.  
Each day we wake, no chance to sleep,  
To live in pain is all we know.

**Chorus**
Look to the sky, where Varis fights,  
A legend’s flame that pierces night.  
Look to yourself, in darkest times,  
He leads us forth with valor bright.

**Coda**
Look to the sky, a beam of light,  
From heaven to earth, brilliant tow'r
Look to yourself, embrace the fight,  
This shining hope will give us power.
