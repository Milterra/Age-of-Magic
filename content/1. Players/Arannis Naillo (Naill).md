# Background
Naill witnessed the suffering of his kin—their lives traded like commodities to other Vel Thurrians and Milterrans. Yet, hidden within the oppressive darkness, he discovered whispers of a drow who defied convention: Drizzt Do'Urden. Drizzts tales of honor, compassion, and rebellion against the wicked ways of the drow captivated Naill. 

Arannis's seclusion began when he was falsely accused of a crime after being traded to [Garena](5.%20Locations/Garena/Garena.md). To escape persecution, he retreated to the isolated high altitude mountains of Garena that only selected few can withstand. There, surrounded by thin breeze of air and the calmness of rocky ores, he meditated on his fate. 

In his meditation, Arannis Naillos wild magic awakened. His drow blood pulsed with chaotic energy, a force that defied the rigid rules of the Underdark. He bore the mark of wild magic. He had glimpsed the Far Realm, where reality twisted like a kaleidoscope, and there, a fey creature—an enigmatic being of shimmering light—had bestowed upon him this gift. His veins pulsed with untamed energy, and he knew that he was both blessed and cursed. Arannis vowed to master it, for it held the key to unraveling the web of injustices and evil that ensnared him and his race. 

And so, Arannis Naillo emerged from his hermitage, wild magic crackling around him. The truth awaited, and with each chaotic surge, he drew closer to rewriting history, to confront injustices, and to illuminate his race. "Chaos guides me, he murmured, "and I shall shape it in return.”
