# Information
**Name:** Iivanna Phyrdin 

**Race:** Drow elf 

**Background:** Urchin 

**Class & Level:** Paladin 2 

**Description:** Iivanna has obsidian skin, silver hair that she keeps in a short uneven do (kinda looks like she cuts it herself), and pale lilac eyes. Somewhat short for an elf at 5â€™8, she has a wiry but muscular frame, built over years of training as a paladin. She often has a hard look to her face and is not one to smile very often. The few times that she does, it is when conversing with her pet rat.

# Background
Raised in a great deal of hardship, Iivanna had to leave her home. She ended up living on the streets in her youth, having to steal food occasionally to keep herself alive. That was when she was saved by her god, and ever since then she has vowed to serve her god as a holy warrior.
