# Information
**Name**: Rhyne 

**Race**: Half-elf 

**Background**: Outlander 

**Class & Level**: Wizard 2 (Necromancer) 

**Description**: Small in stature and slight in build, Rhyne prefers to stay in the shadows where she can observe others. She is a half-elf, with slightly pointed ears, golden eyes, and long unkempt black hair streaked with white. Although she is young, years of living in the forest and training as a wizard are evident in the calluses on her hands and the dark circles under her eyes.

# Background
A shy young wizard in training, Rhyne grew up in the wilderness of [Namine Forest](5.%20Locations/Points%20of%20Interest/Namine%20Forest.md) away from civilization with only her mentor, the wizard [Søren](Søren), as her guardian and companion. One day, however, Søren embarks on a mysterious trip and never returns, leaving her with only his destination: [Gien](content/5.%20Locations/Agnor/Gien.md). Much of what she knows about the world has come from her books; perhaps this is why she is secretive and slow to trust others. But those who can see beyond her cold demeanor will find a fiercely loyal friend and companion under her icy exterior.
