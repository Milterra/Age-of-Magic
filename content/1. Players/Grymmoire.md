# Information
**Name**: Grymmoire (Grym) 

**Race**: Dragonborn 

**Background**: Disgraced Researcher 

**Class & Level**: Bard (2)

**Description**: Grymmoire is the oldest of the party - leaning towards 60 years old in-game. You can see the age affecting his posture and appearance - tattered clothes, graying of what seemed to blue scales at one point, and very stiff movement (almost deliberately slow). But the eyes (despite expecting to be eye-bagged or sullen) still remain a piercing yellow.


# Background
Born and grew up in [Trisselon](5.%20Locations/Trisselon/Trisselon.md). Upbringing with interest in animals and certain songs and sounds. I used to have a neighboring 
 
Grew up making an accordina/melodica, a mix of a flute and a keyboard. Relatively unique or new as a musical instrument. I once discarded it to pursue my studies in Agnor, but I still bring it around with me wherever I go.
 
Took up studies in Agnor (where I decidedly focused on how divine magic and the animals can interact with each other). I, of course, learned some magic spells, though that was never my primary intention. I wanted to understand the land of Milterra and wher and where the divides began and lost.
 
[Milin](Milin) cut ties with me...
 
I ended up becoming a minstrel stuck in [Noria](5.%20Locations/Agnor/Noria.md), working up just enough coppers up to the position where we begin in the story. No other institutions would want to hire someone who's violated some rule in a prestigious establishment, add to the fact that I'm nearing such old age and have a severe lack of vitality.
 
I currently reside in the cramped basement of an old friend from Milin - Salispier. While still tied to Milin, she worked as an assistant to one of the librarians. They probably think I can still uncover something new about Milterra, be it religious or scientific. Animal or god. They just don't know that I did uncover something.
