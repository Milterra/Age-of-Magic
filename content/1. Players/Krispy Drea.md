# Background
Krispy Drea is a merchant from [Noria](../5.%20Locations/Agnor/Noria.md). Her shop specializes in magical items, her regular clientele being the students and _researchers_(?) from the local campus of [Milin](Milin). While she's been handling these magical items for a good while, she's only recently (and accidentally) discovered that she has magic of her own.
