Walk into an armory in any kingdom and you’ll find that half of them were made in Garena. Chances are, the other half was also made by a dwarf in the city. These small but stout creatures are known worldwide for their skill in metalworking, compounded by their partnership with ingenious humans that steadily improve their methods of production.

The capital city of [Garett](Garett) is carved into the side of a mountain in the middle of [Yondar’s Valley](Yondar’s%20Valley), the widest pass of the [Denuli mountain range](Denuli%20mountain%20range) that connects Milterra to the northern islands. These mountain ranges are rich in ores, a fact taken advantage of by the first dwarven tribes that settled in these lands. But it wasn’t until the humans arrived and began a friendly relationship with the dwarven settlements that the nation of Garena was born, a powerhouse of industry and metalworks.

Garena is a republic governed by [The Assembly](old/5.%20Locations/Garena/The%20Assembly.md), a collection of eight dwarven representatives and eight human representatives presided over by a prime chancellor. The representatives are voted into office by the constituents of their district or guild, and the prime chancellor is voted into office by the sixteen representatives.

The national religion of Garena is [Theros](old/6.%20Lore/Religion/Dominant%20Pantheon/Theros.md) whose patron god is [Therok](Therok), the god of death and earth. Intriguingly, the common man is not regularly involved with worship in the Theros religion. They believe that they are serving their god by following their calling in life. The priesthood prays on their behalf and is largely responsible for performing the rituals involved in their worship. What these rituals are is unknown to most, even to their own followers, for they do these behind closed doors and is held secret to those outside the clergy.

Their main exports are weapons and armor, for the continent is more than willing to pay a premium for anything made by dwarven hands. Though steel is the common metal of choice in many dwarven products, they also work with other metals like brass, mithril, and more recently, [malluminium](malluminium). However, these are largely custom-made and beyond the budget of ordinary men.
