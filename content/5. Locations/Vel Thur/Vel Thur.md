The great forest of the north is home to the firstborn elves, a graceful and proud people that live for thousands of years. Their religion claims that the elves emerged from the roots of [Veleria](5.%20Locations/Points%20of%20Interest/Veleria%20World%20Tree.md), the World Tree and were welcomed by the goddess [Rysiel](4.%20Characters/Gods/Rysiel.md) herself. As such, they hold themselves superior to the rest of Milterra. Elvish culture is slow and tedious, at least by mortal standards. They prefer to linger upon the smallest decisions and are rarely in a hurry to finish their task.

There are three tribes of elves: the high elves, the wood elves, and the drows. While the wood elves and the high elves prefer the open space of the Vel Thur forest, the drows like to live in the darkness of the caves beneath the western mountains. Legends say that the wood elves and the high elves find it an affront to their holy heritage for the drows to live underground, the supposed domain of [Therok](Therok), Rysiel’s rival brother. As such, they waged war upon the drows and, upon their victory, enslaved the entire race. Later, during the peace accords, the elves conceded the ancestral mountain homes of the drows to [Garena](5.%20Locations/Garena/Garena.md) as a bargaining chip. This caused dissent and rage within the drows, who feel that their homeland had been prostituted to foreigners.

[Vespera](Vespera) is the capital city of the elves, situated a small distance away from the World Tree. The city is built within a forest of gigantic trees. As such, elvish architecture tend towards curves and spirals, as opposed to the square foundations of human and dwarven architecture. Elvish houses shape themselves around the natural shape of the trees, and their roads meander through the enormous buttress roots dominating the forest floor. Their cities are built as much upwards as it is outwards, with Vespera touting more than ten levels of structures connected by wood and steel bridges spanning between trees.

Elvish religion is strictly [Rysellian](6.%20Lore/Religion/Dominant%20Pantheon/Rysellian.md) whose patron goddess is Rysiel, the goddess of life and the source that powers healing magic. Religious rituals are elaborate and traditionally took years to finish. However, following extensive contact with the other races, they’ve since adapted it to be shorter and more… mortal-friendly.

Vel Thur is ruled by the clergy, with a council of elders presiding over national matters. The central government lies not in its capital city, but at the foot of the World Tree where the majestic [](old/5.%20Locations/Points%20of%20Interest/Veleria%20World%20Tree.md#Garden%20of%20Life|Garden%20of%20Life) temple sits nestled between two gigantic roots. Pilgrims and worshippers frequently visit the temple, sharing the road with court functionaries that keep the national government running.

Elves are no natural merchants, but they do welcome foreign merchants bringing goods from all over the continent. In turn, these merchants seek the masterworks of elvish artisans who have been practicing their art for hundreds, if not thousands of years. It is said that paintings from Vel Thur have impossibly varied colors, and their sculptures capture their subject down to the individual strand of hair.
