# Districts

## **Old Gien** 
The district of Old Gien stands out immediately. It is a weird collection of buildings and tents and buildings that were made to look like tents. A stallholder on the street tells you that Gien's townsfolk are proud about how far and how fast the town has grown and Old Gien is a living history of its humble beginnings. 

## **Clearwater District** 
The Clearwater District is the newest part of town, built for the increasingly wealthy patrons that travel to Gien for business, curiosity, or necessity. Glass windows, streetlamps, luxury stores, and clean streets are sure signs that you've entered Clearwater. There is also an abunance of men in uniform outside multiple establishments, likely personal bodyguards of somebody inside. 

## **Slywind District** 
The Slywind district is mostly residential. Unlike the rest of Gien, the streets are quiet and rarely full. Many houses are wooden, rarely stone, and a lot of them seems communal. Lining one street are balconies from the second floor, colorful from the laundry that they hung on rope and twine. The easternmost edge of town also contains a field of tents for temporary visitors of town. 

## **Spice Alley**
One can say that the only reason people go to Gien is to visit Spice Alley, the collection of merchants, vendors, and smugglers from all over Milterra who proudly display their wares on their own shops, in stalls on the streets, or in back-alley dealings. The streets here are perpetually loud, either from the criers selling news from afar, the sound of blacksmiths pounding on steel, shopkeepers catching your attention, or just the general din of a hundred people on the same road. Oh and the smell! The strange, wonderful smells of exotic food and perfumes coupled with unwashed bodies and nasty alleys (you took one regretful look into a random alley and you can't be sure if what you saw was vomit or shit).

# Inns

## **Lionheart Inn:** 
The Lionheart Inn offers the most luxurious food and lodging in the city. It is owned by Reavan Lionheart (you have a suspicious feeling that's not his real name), a professional-looking businessman who also serves as the front desk clerk. He has maids and butlers (in appropriate attires) escorting guests and doing menial work. The inn has a fine dining hall with an expensive but delicious buffet (though food can be delivered to your room), stables at the back, a courtyard in front able to receive carriages, and private baths in every room (hot water can be requested and delivered). 

**Staying at the inn costs 3gp per day, inclusive of food and decent wine.** 

## **Gloria's Embrace:** 
Gloria's Embrace reminds you of the Lionheart Inn if the paint was peeling and the serving hands were swearing. The facade looks respectable, with glass windows and a flowering bush surrounding the sides of the building. Entering the place, you see an array of tables with drunkards roaring in laughter. They aren't as bad as some of the seedier inns that you may have encountered in your travels, but it is obvious that this establishment looks more... affordable than the previous inn. Looking closely, the drunkards are wearing fine silk and jewelry. This seems to be a place for the more successful merchants of Gien. The owner is a tiefling with a mischievous smile, sitting behind the bar. They introduce themselves as [Charity](content/4.%20Characters/Gien%20Persons%20of%20Interest.md), an affable innkeeper with red skin, bright yellow eyes, and a magnificent crown of horns. 

**They tell you that staying at the inn costs 1gp and 5sp per day, inclusive of food and cheap wine.**
