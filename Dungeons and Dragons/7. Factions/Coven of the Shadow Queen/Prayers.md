### Prayer of Strength
Hail goddess of blood,
One true god of Milterra
Show mercy upon thy humble servant
That my feeble existence be granted audience

Purge the weakness in my heart
Grant me passage through this darkness
Give me strength to serve thy purpose
So I may live and worship your name

And once I rise victorious
Through your holy intercession
The blood of your enemies will flow
And your empire will rise once more

### Hail Holy Queen
Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Vengeance
Hail thy blood, thy shadows and thy spite
To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Rys
To thee do we send up our sighs
Mourning and weeping in this cavern of tears
Turn then, goddess superior, thine eyes of mercy toward us.
And after this our exile, show unto us the blessed world
of thy promised empire of drows
Oh bitter, Oh baleful,
Oh malefic Shadow Queen

We pray to thee,
Almighty and everlasting goddess,
Who, by the toil and labor of your servants
didst prepare both body and soul of Sabrina Delafontaine,
that she might deserve to be made a worthy dwelling for Thy Soul
Grant that we who persevered through the ages, by thy permission
be delivered from present evils and be granted a seat at thy empire
