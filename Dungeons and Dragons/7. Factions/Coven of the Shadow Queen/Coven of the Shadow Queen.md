The drow worship an ancient religion stretching back thousands of years. Their patron goddess is the [Queen of Shadow and Blood](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Eradawn%20Rebellion/Coven/Queen%20of%20Shadow%20and%20Blood.md), an exotic deity lost to history and remembered only by the elves. Elder priests teach that the religion was eradicated by the elves who wanted to impose [Rysellian](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/6.%20Lore/Religion/Dominant%20Pantheon/Rysellian.md) upon all of elvenkind, believing it to be their rightful religion as it was [Rysiel](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Gods/Rysiel.md) who birthed them. A war was waged, one involving all the races of Milterra against the drows, and they lost, choosing slavery over extinction.

The Queen of Shadow and Blood’s domain is magic, blood, and darkness. Her religion teaches that survival comes before everything else, a tradition born from thousands of years of oppression. Anything is permitted, so long as it helps them survive. Beyond that, the Coven believes that passion and ambition are worthy pursuits. Their religious symbol is a three-pronged crown, and their common gesture of worship is to claw their index, middle, and ring finger in the shape of a crown and scratch it over their heart.

One of their regular rituals involves sacrificing wild game such as deer and hogs in an elaborate religious ceremony. The animal is bled to death and the priests bathe in their blood. Followers are then given the opportunity to dip their fingers in the blood and paint it all over their body, usually drawing the three-pronged crown over their heart. Afterwards, the animal is cooked and shared in a communal meal, with every drow invited to feast. In a large settlement such as [Achlendell](Achlendell), multiple animals are slaughtered so that everybody gets to eat.

[The Wisdom](The%20Wisdom) leads the Coven and, by extension, Achlendell. She is a wizened old druid who is rumored to have been alive during the days of the Shadow Queen. She is powerful and wise and has dedicated her whole life to the preservation of the drow race. With the founding of [Agnor](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/5.%20Locations/Agnor/Agnor.md) fifty years ago, she swiftly moved the coven from the caves of [Vel Thur](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/5.%20Locations/Vel%20Thur/Vel%20Thur.md) to the [Ebennor mountain](Ebennor%20mountain), where they found an extensive network of caves in the foothills. There, she established Achlendell with the help of [Xartur](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Eradawn%20Rebellion/Xartur.md), the leader of the [Eradawn rebellion](Eradawn%20rebellion) whose people had been rescuing drow refugees for centuries. Now, Achlendell serves as the religious capital of the free drows, though it remains hidden and unknown to most of the world.

The paladins of the Coven report to [Diobe](Diobe) (Thee-yo-be), a blue-skinned drow. He is hot-headed, deeply religious, and loyal to the cause. Paladin recruits often look up to him as a role model of zealotry and service. The clerics are led by [Keyila](Keyila) (Ke-yee-la) the granddaughter of the Wisdom. She is a solemn drow who has her grandmother’s white hair and obsidian skin, but none of her gentle features.

The Coven is a deeply held secret. The Wisdom demands the utmost secrecy from every drow, reminding them that death and annihilation await their race if the world learns of their god and its worship. As such, drows outwardly worship one of the three main gods of Milterra. Interestingly, the Shadow Queen doesn’t seem to mind, as drow paladins and clerics are granted her power despite them using the signs and prayers of other religions.

Initiated members of the Coven priesthood (clerics, priests, paladins) know that the Wisdom and Xartur are planning something big. They have slowly mobilized the paladin and cleric orders, sending them to obscure missions across Milterra. The Wisdom herself has made a few speeches in private to reaffirm their loyalty to the Coven. She talked of lost glory and a new age, of the Shadow Queen rewarding the faithful, and of the ancestral empire that they would soon reclaim.
