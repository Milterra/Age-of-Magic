When she was a mortal queen of the Underdark, the [Shadow Queen](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Eradawn%20Rebellion/Coven/Queen%20of%20Shadow%20and%20Blood.md) was a powerful wizard who enchanted four items with powerful magic. These enchantments were designed to help in her quest to ascend to godhood.

# Crown of Shadows
The Shadow Queen enchanted the ancestral crown of the drow monarchy to be the symbol of her power. Calling it the [Crown of Shadows](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/8.%20Items/Artifacts%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Queen/Crown%20of%20Shadows.md), she imbued it with the ability to elevate the magical potential of the wearer, allowing them to cast spells one tier above their limit. The Shadow Queen needed this ability to raise her 9th level spell limit to Legendary tier, allowing her to cast the [Apotheiosis](Apotheiosis) spell.

# Aracranomicon
The Shadow Queen was a powerful wizard who knew powerful and forgotten magics. As such, her spellbook, the [Aracranomicon](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/8.%20Items/Artifacts%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Queen/Aracranomicon.md) is a library of incalculable worth to wizards and magic researchers. Inscribed on this spellbook, hidden by powerful magic that can only be revealed with a modified Legend Lore spell (or one casted with a 9th level spell slot), is the [Apotheiosis](Apotheiosis) spell.

# The Dawnstaff/Duskstaff
The [Dawnstaff](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/8.%20Items/Artifacts%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Queen/Dawnstaff.md) is the arcane focus of the Shadow Queen. It is a legendary staff that predates the Shadow Queen's time, recovered from a gold dragon's treasure trove. Its ability to store and overcharge spells was considered necessary to ensure the success of the [Apotheiosis](Apotheiosis) spell.

Originally, the name of the staff was the Dawnstaff, but it became known as the Duskstaff after being wielded by the Shadow Queen.

# The Mageheart
The Shadow Queen knew that eating the [](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/5.%20Locations/Points%20of%20Interest/Veleria%20World%20Tree.md#Fruit|Fruit%20of%20Veleria), containing a divine spark, would kill most mortal creatures. To survive the ascension, she fashioned the [Mageheart](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/8.%20Items/Artifacts%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Queen/Mageheart.md), a magical aura bound to a necklace that improves the constitution of the wearer. This aura would also gain power from the suffering of nearby creatures and use it to project a barrier around the wearer.
