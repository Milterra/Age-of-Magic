# Crown of Shadows
Magic item. Requires drow magic to activate. Doubles the proficiency of the wearer when doing stealth checks. Adds +2 to AC.

### Ascendant (Hidden)
The crown collects the souls of everything that dies within 60 feet of it (100 meters at level 4, 500 meters feet at level 8, 1 kilometers at level 12, and about a large battlefield at level 16). After a certain amount of souls have been harvested, the next non-cantrip spell cast by the wearer is cast a level above, if possible. Certain souls have more weight (aka count as +2 or +3 etc), as determined by the DM. However, as the crown is used, the Queen of Shadow and Blood slowly corrupts the user, ultimately taking over the body. (need to prepare the madness table for this)

Engraved on the crown, in Sylvan, is “Crown of blood, crown of power, crown of the eternal ruler”
