## Reminar’s Warehouse

[Reminar](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Eradawn%20Rebellion/Coven/Reminar.md) greets the party and expects the [Crown of Shadows](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/8.%20Items/Artifacts%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Queen/Crown%20of%20Shadows.md). Upon learning that one of the PCs attuned it, he gets angry before storming off to find his boss, [Lazari Saavedra](Lazari%20Saavedra). However, unlike Reminar, Lazari doesn’t seem to be angry at this outcome. Instead, he is curious to know more about Nile (and Iivana, once he learns that she was also tempted). He will also want to gauge the opinions of everyone regarding drows.

Lazari doesn’t mind giving the crown to the party, but he will demand that they pay him back in return. He demands that the adventurers do some tasks for him, giving them three options to start with:

1. Help a village that’s plagued by a disease
2. Research some exotic thing for him (the next artifact, Aracranomicon), which will involve some library hunting and maybe some exploration
3. (If he thinks that the party is sympathetic to the drow cause) help Xartur with smuggling drows out of Vel Thur

Lazari won’t insist that they make a choice now, instead encouraging them to spend the day exploring the city as they wish. He will also let them keep Alexander’s Ruby if he finds out about its existence, suggesting that they visit [](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/3.%20Encounters/Chapter%201/Gien%20Encounters.md#Gemheart%20Jewelry|Gemheart%20Jewelry) to sell it off and use the money to prepare for their chosen task.

## Temple of Metria

The temple of [Metria](Metria) is the biggest building in the town, made of austere blocks of stone. Here, people mainly seek healing from the priests (for a price). You often encounter people from nearby hamlets and villages who made the trek to Gien just so that a priest can have them healed.

The local Metrian bishop is named Jolly Brookling, a slimy halfling who seems to have made more money than is proper from the temple healings. The two clerics with him are also part of this dishonesty, using their limited daily spell slots as an excuse to turn away poorer citizens in favor of wealthy patrons who are more likely to pay handsomely for the service. As a result, the local clinics are always filled with people turned away by the temple.

## Gemheart Jewelry

This is a small but luxurious jewelry store in the Clear Water district. A barrier of protection is erected over the establishment, and any Echoes Human can hear the sound as they approach the shop. This barrier protects the jewelry store by blinking red and making a very loud sound (audible throughout the whole street) when a piece of jewelry is taken out of the shop without the owner’s permission (the owner taps the piece with a magical artifact to “exclude” it from the barrier’s protection).

The owner is Thal Chadbeard, a half-orc with surprisingly delicate hands. He is immaculately dressed in a formal tunic, as befitting his usual patrons. Thal is condescending towards customers who look like they can’t afford his wares and will have the same attitude towards the party unless they take the time to dress up. However, he will quickly turn friendly once he learns that they are adventurers, as he knows that they often find precious gems on the job.

He will offer 250gp for Alexander’s Ruby but can be convinced with a DC 15 (persuasion) check to raise it to 300gp. If the players are exceptional at bargaining, he may even offer to pay higher, but no more than 400gp.

## The Lionheart Inn

The Lionheart Inn offers the most luxurious food and lodging in the city. It is owned by Reavan Lionheart (not his real surname), a professional-looking businessman who also serves as the front desk clerk. He has maids and butlers (in appropriate attires) escorting guests and doing menial work. 
The lobby of the inn is ornate, being decorated with expensive carpets of red and gold, pottery and glassware in their own stands, as well as a fine tapestry of a majestic lion dominating one wall. The inn has a fine dining hall with an expensive but delicious buffet (though food can be delivered to your room), stables at the back, a courtyard in front able to receive carriages, and private baths in every ro   om (hot water can be requested and delivered).

Staying at the inn costs 3gp per day, inclusive of food and decent wine.

## The Merchant’s Guild

The guild consists of an administrative building where people can sign up to be a part of the guild. However, you must present evidence that you have a respectable business (like a business permit from the city/town hall). Most of the buildings are warehouses, as the guild offers storage services of stock for members. There is security all over the compound.

## Gloria’s Embrace Inn

Gloria's Embrace reminds you of the Lionheart Inn if the paint was peeling and the serving hands were swearing. The facade looks respectable, with glass windows and a flowering bush surrounding the sides of the building. Entering the place, you see an array of tables with drunkards roaring in laughter. They aren't as bad as some of the seedier inns that you may have encountered in your travels, but it is obvious that this establishment looks more... affordable than the previous inn. Looking closely, the drunkards are wearing fine silk and jewelry. This seems to be a place for the more successful merchants of Gien. 

The owner is a tiefling with a mischievous smile, sitting behind the bar. They introduce themselves as Charity Tris, an affable innkeeper with red skin, bright yellow eyes, and a magnificent crown of horns. They tell you that staying at the inn costs 1gp and 5sp per day, inclusive of food and cheap wine.

## The City Library

Though a small town, Gien’s small library contains a few rare books that was brought by travelling merchants and spotted by the fastidious librarian, Stella Moran. Stella lives a modest lifestyle, preferring to spend the library’s budget on the collections of travelling merchants who intend to sell rare books to the library in Noria.

Stella is particularly interested in old folklore and legends. Her research has given her a sense that many of these legends are connected in some way, such as some being identical in theme and story beats despite originating from the opposite ends of Milterra. She has heard of the Shadow queen being mentioned as a great evil in some children’s tales, but knows nothing else.

If the party visits the City Library, they may encounter [Lina Verena](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Milin%20Prime/Lina%20Verena.md), a popular Charmcaster from Noria’s Milin. Characters who are willing to spend money to watch plays might know Lina as a rising star, a virtuoso at Charmcasting whose career is only hindered by her deep interest in study and research. Lina has a bubbly and contagious personality, augmented by her child-like voice and frenetic energy. She is a wizard of the school of illusions, having graduated from Milin with very high honors.

## City Hall

Not much to do here, unless the party finds themselves in jail or having committed a minor crime. If they wish to report Recalor’s greedy ways to the mayor, they will find that the mayor doesn’t care much, saying “Money is the lifeblood of this town, my dear friends. How else is the temple supposed to feed itself?”
