# Tomb of Heroes
The [Artifacts of the Shadow Queen](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/8.%20Items/Artifacts%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Queen/Artifacts%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Queen.md) are all secured in a domain (pocket dimension) guarded by one of the four heroes (except for Varis, who is [buried in the Garena mountains](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/6.%20Lore/Stories/The%20Beacon%20of%20Hope.md)). Each tomb is a dungeon themed towards the hero's particular theme
- The [Tomb of Alexander](Alexander's%20Tomb) (graveyard aesthetic)
- The Tomb of Relfyr - need ideas
	- Dungeon with a permanent silence spell
	- Dungeon where they all need to sneak past an unkillable foe
	- Dungeon where all the monsters are one hit but they also deal insane damage
	- an invisible boss
- The Tomb of Jomanda - need ideas
	- Dungeon where magic doesn't work/goes haywire
	- Tomb where the PCs have to fight a perfect clone of themselves (Frieren, literally)
	- possibly located inside [The Maw](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/5.%20Locations/Garena/The%20Maw.md), in the Garena mountains
		- themed as a city where they have to
- The Tomb of Skaa ()
	- p

All of these tombs are located outside space and time, and so need to be anchored to the material plane through some means.
