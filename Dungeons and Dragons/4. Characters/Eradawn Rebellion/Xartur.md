A drow fighter who leads the drow rebellion. He was a gladiator slave in one of the illegal fighting dens in Vel Thur, trained from a young age to fight and kill. He escaped when the establishment was raided by elvish officials and the ensuing fight caused the building to burn down. Many of the slave fighters couldnâ€™t escape their shackles and burned down with the building, but one elvish constabulary managed to get to the slave pens and free Xartur. While the elf was busy trying to free the other slaves, Xartur took the opportunity to run out of the burrow and into the night. Since then, he has spent nearly three centuries breaking drow slaves out of their confinement and smuggling them out of the country.
