Sister of [Reminar](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Eradawn%20Rebellion/Coven/Reminar.md), lives a quiet life as a maid in [Lazari’s](Lazari%20Saavedra) employ. She thinks that Lazari is a very kind man who can do no wrong. Falin thinks highly of Reminar’s job as a mercenary, as the man used to be hired as a caravan guard in Slyphon. She doesn’t know about Lazari or Reminar’s role in the drow rebellion. Incidentally, she’s a very nice person who feels bad about the world’s treatment of drows and tieflings.
