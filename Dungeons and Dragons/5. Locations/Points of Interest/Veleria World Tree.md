The tree that has existed since the beginning of time. Accumulates the mana of the planet and distills them into its fruits

### Garden of Life

### Fruit
The fruit of the Veleria World Tree is one of the most sought after magic item in Milterra. 

#### World Seed
A planet’s worth of magic gathered for thousands of years and distilled into the fruit of Veleria. This is an incredibly powerful magic source containing a divine spark, enough that it distorts the spacetime around it. Non-magicians and magicians who can perform spells of level 1 to 3 cannot eat the fruit; any who takes one bite is consumed by a fiery burst of mana. Magicians who can perform spells of level 4 to 7 are afflicted with varying degrees of mana overload:

- 4 - permanent and incurable magic crystallization (their body grows crystals whenever they use magic, slowly killing them)
- 5 - lose control over magic (roll on the Wild Magic Sorcerer table after every use of magic), gain a lesser version of magic crystallization that can be cured;
- 6 - every use of magic requires a flat d20 roll (DC 10). On a failure, roll on the Wild Magic Sorcerer table. On a success, modify your spell with any Sorcerer Metamagic without spending any sorcery points, if able
- 7 -  refresh all your used spell slots at all levels

Magicians who can perform spells of level 8 and 9 are strong enough to consume and use the World Seed. They gain near-unlimited spellcasting for spells level 7 and below, provided they fulfill the VSM components.

More importantly, the World Seed **can power a single cast of Legendary Tier Magic** (ex. the **Apotheosis** spell). Of course, the caster must fulfill the necessary conditions of said magic, which are often esoteric, undoubtedly deadly, and require years of planning and preparation.
