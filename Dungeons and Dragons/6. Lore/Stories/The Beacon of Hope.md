Also known as (The Call to Arms, The Oath of Varis, The Guardian's Poem, Look to the Sky)
quick and dirty recap:

- when the sun goes down
- and you hear the baying of wolves
- and the chill winds blow east
- then look to the sky

- when the moon comes out
- and the flames dance through your crops
- and you hear the thundering of hooves
- then look to the sky

- when the night grows dark
- and the waves crash against our walls
- and our heroes fall wayward
- then look to the sky

- When the sun goes down
- listen to the sound of your heart
- feel the warmth of your blood 
- then look to the sky

- when the moon comes out
- fan the flames of your anger
- march to the sound of steel
- then look to the sky

- when the night grows dark
- let the rain wash away our tears
- and claim the fragments of courage within
- then look to the sky

- A pillar of light shall pierce the sky
- A call to fight 
- 
- The dawn shall rise once more
