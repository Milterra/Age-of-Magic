#Baikagiri
There is a mystical place told in stories. A world that exists between heartbeats. A moment caught between dreams. A sunset frozen in time. They call this place _Baikagiri_, an ancient word whose true meaning was long forgotten, but one that inspired generations of names for that single place where the souls of the worthy come to rest. The Crossroads of Choice, the Final Sunset, and perhaps the most famous, the Twilight of Heroes.

Tales of Baikagiri were told across the land. Ancient hymns and local legends all mention a place of momentous meeting. Country folklore and city dramas speak of a place of destiny, where the hero comes across their past and makes a choice about the future. Wonders were built and wars were waged under the word of one who claimed were called to the Twilight. Perhaps what is most remarkable, what makes the place that they call the Final Sunset so compellingly believable, is that all the stories, from the frozen edge of the world to the burning desert of the west, and despite being separated by a thousand leagues and a continent, describe the same poignant scene.

Skysea, they call it. The entire sky reflected down on a boundless sea of still water. The dark of night, above and below, transitioning into a blue sky half-hidden by orange clouds, then converges on an brilliant ball of fire. The reddish blaze of its setting sun lie half hidden under the horizon, so as to complete a perfect circle with its reflection on the water. So many stories from so many ages, but they all describe the same scene: an infinite sea mirroring the setting sun, and on it, the hero making a choice.

It is said that Baikagiri calls only those who were meant for greatness. That the magic of the place only summons those who can change the world. Why, then, am I here, called into this beautifully bitter sight of the eternal Twilight, my memories playing on the still waters of the sea? I had never really understood that part of the story. Heroes talk and pace and run across Baikagiri, and yet they say that the water remains ever still and unmoving. Now I see what they mean. I lift my foot up and down and the water ripples out weakly, as if eager to remain still and untarnished.

But I could not ponder that for too long. My sight is captivated by the water in front of me as it displays images from my mind over and over again, all the precious and lonely memories of a time long gone. Echoes of a Friend that I will never see again.

There is a certain pattern to the things that the water is showing me. A sort of twisted drive to make me remember all the significant moments, the best and the worst, the smiles and the tears. Rubbing salt to a bleeding heart. I clench my fists and close my eyes, but in the darkness I could see my Friend. The smile of a flower opening for the sun, my Friend was the blooming of spring that brings life to the room. Now the sight brings winter to my heart.

_You are the cause of this coldness in me_, I think bitterly. _You left us too young, too early. Didn’t we agree to go to the festival together?_

Remember. How I remember as my chest tightens and I catch a breath.

The water ripples and the visions on the water fade. I am startled out of my melancholy, frantically looking for the source of the ripple. It seemed to have come behind me, so I turn and–

“Hey.”

I freeze. The endless night is dark behind her, and yet the sunset behind me gives her a warm glow that seemed incomparably dim to the smile on her face. A poignant smile, for she knew as much as I how fleeting this meeting would be. An impossible meeting outside the stream of time.

"You've gone and grown up on me, haven't you?" she said, even as I rush towards her in an embrace. I could not, dared not, stop the tears flowing-
