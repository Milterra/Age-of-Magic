The scouring of Centoria is perhaps the greatest shame of Slyphon. Even today, two millennia after it happened, the kingdom still refuses to officially recognize and apologize for the tragedy. Perhaps they realize that the genocide of an entire nation is something that nobody can truly forgive, even two thousand years after the fact. Many scholars have written about the events leading up to the scouring, but I place little value in their works. Much of the accounts from that time are contradictory, even factitious, and their works do not show the rigor of modern historiography. Thus, it is the objective of my thesis to scrutinize existing literature, separate facts from fiction, unearth lost and unknown accounts of the era, and finally elucidate the true history of the destruction of Centoria.

Let us begin with an excerpt from the treatise of Frabdus:

> 	The Scouring of Centoria is a military campaign prosecuted by Slyphon against a small neighboring kingdom to the north. At the time, Centoria was a prosperous nation enriched by its gold mines and its fortuitous location as a natural waystop for merchants travelling the road between Slyphon and Vel Thur. 
> 	An account of the time indicated that the citizens of Centoria were incredibly wealthy that they engaged in reckless indulgence and gross debauchery. Leftover food trickled to the streets enough to sustain a small population of the wretched homeless. Sodomy and corruption were commonplace enough that prostitutes and customers alike flocked to the city in droves. 
> 	King Caesar of Slyphon saw this festering evil and demanded that Centora cease their unholy rites at once. The records are sparse regarding their response, but it is obvious that Centoria refused the charge. This angered the king enough that he pursued a holy war to cleanse the north of its corruption.
