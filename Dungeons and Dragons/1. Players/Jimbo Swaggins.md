# Information
**Name:** Jimbo Swaggins 
**Race:** Halfling 
**Background:** "Acolyte"
**Class & Level**: Cleric (Trickery) 2

**Description**: What Jimbo lacks in size, he makes up for in smiles and appetite. Given his small stature and nondescript appearance, he strives to stand out by donning his "fancy coat" and striking up conversations with anyone he meets; often with a twinkle of mischief in his gray eyes. Years of living in service to his deity has led to him always being ready with a kind word (or a healing one) for those in need.

**Back Story**: Jimbo was raised in the city of Noria by his adoptive family, who run a small temple/museum dedicated to Metria. He and his siblings have taken over most of the day-to-day management of the family business as their parents have gotten older. As Jimbo is in charge of External Affairs And Procurement, he has decided to leave the comfort of the city for a time in order to better explore the outside world and hopefully make some new friends along the way.
