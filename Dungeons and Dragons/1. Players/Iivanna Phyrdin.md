# Information
**Name:** Iivanna Phyrdin 
**Race:** Drow elf 
**Background:** Urchin 
**Class & Level:** Paladin 2 

**Description:** Iivanna has obsidian skin, silver hair that she keeps in a short uneven do (kinda looks like she cuts it herself), and pale lilac eyes. Somewhat short for an elf at 5â€™8, she has a wiry but muscular frame, built over years of training as a paladin. She often has a hard look to her face and is not one to smile very often. The few times that she does, it is when conversing with her pet rat. 

**Back Story:** Raised in a great deal of hardship, Iivanna had to leave her home. She ended up living on the streets in her youth, having to steal food occasionally to keep herself alive. That was when she was saved by her god, and ever since then she has vowed to serve her god as a holy warrior.

	- Lazari is pushing for her and [Naill](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/1.%20Players/Arannis%20Naillo%20(Naill).md) to help [Xartur](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Eradawn%20Rebellion/Xartur.md) smuggle some drow slaves out of Vel Thur

Inevitable plot point:
- What will she do when she finds out her patron goddess is fantasy Hitler who wants to elevate the Drow as the aryan race and exterminate the rest?

# Real Background
**Personality Traits**
- I am slow to trust. I sleep with one eye open and am ready to leave at a moment's notice
- I talk to my rat
- I eat like a pig and collect leftovers

**Ideals**
- Change: the time has come for drows to break their shackles and for the slave drivers to meet their retribution

**Bonds**
- I am loyal to the people and leaders of Achlendell. I would do anything to protect it

**Flaws**
- My sense of justice is based on haves and have notes. It's not stealing if it's from the rich. 
- Survival above all else.

**Backstory**
Originally from Vel Thur, where enslavement of my kind remains legal and commonplace, my family and I served as slaves to one of the elven nobility. I was old enough to experience the mistreatment of the drows, but too young to understand why this was happening. One night, my parents had woken me and rushed me to the border, providing no explanation but a small figurine. I was hidden onboard a cart headed to Agnor, arriving in Devlindel. 

There, I spent years on the streets, barely being able to scrape past by stealing food and hiding from authorities, until a drow caught me stealing from her and brought me to the outskirts. I thought she was going to kill me, until she led me to the mouth of a cave at the foot of the mountain. From then on, I was taken in by my fellow drow in Achlendell, and soon began my training and initiation into their religion. I was eventually chosen by Diobe to serve as a warrior for the Shadow Queen, serving as a paladin in her name ever since.
