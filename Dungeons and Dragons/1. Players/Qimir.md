- Reminar tells him to deliver a letter to [Davos Verena](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Eradawn%20Rebellion/Davos%20Verena.md) (through his daughter, [Lina Verena](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/4.%20Characters/Milin%20Prime/Lina%20Verena.md) who is aware of the rebellion) in exchange for information from Slyphos about a failed assassination attempt (hinting that it was Osha)

# Real Background
Qimir, once a street urchin in the sprawling underground of the capital city, was plucked from obscurity by a master assassin named Sol. Master Sol saw potential in the boy’s quick hands and sharp mind, training him alongside his most trusted protégé, a woman named Osha. The trio became a formidable team, bonded by a shared understanding of the shadows they moved through. Qimir grew to trust Osha like a sister, her presence a rare light in his otherwise dark world. 

When news came that Osha had been killed on a mission gone awry, Qimir’s world shattered, but a sliver of hope kept him from believing she was truly gone. He now moves through the city's underbelly, carrying out contracts with lethal precision while quietly searching for any trace of Osha. Beneath his hardened exterior lies a man with a heart still capable of kindness, though he is slow to trust anyone who crosses his path
