	- got trapped by the shrine, they managed to solve the puzzle
	- managed to get the gemstones out of the mural through sorcery and climbing antics
- found the statue of Varis as well as the Tree of Rest
	- magical 4 hour sleep around the tree that gave a long rest
- midnight by the time they woke up and fought the gargoyle
- rested by Namile's but was woken up by all of the graves having their inhabitants awaken as a skeleton
	- triggered by the killing of the gargoyle
- Namile cleared a path for them, seemingly sacrificing their life for it
- chase scene, Aspen's staircase proved essential as they all scrambled up and over the other side into the innermost part of the tomb (site of gargoyle battle)
	- Grym's old legs tripped, had to be helped by Iivana
	- The party hurriedly put the jewels on the door, fumbling some dexterity checks along the way
	- A skeleton got hold of Iivana's leg as she was the last person to come in
		- Nile saved her by shooting the skeleton's skull with a crossbow

# Summary
- Encountered the endless Dark Staircase, quickly solved the puzzle
- Entered the tomb, saw the wall of bones and the pedestal in the center.
- They noticed the nodes and tried to break it. As soon as they raised their hand, Alexander awakens
- Quick summary of the fight:
	- Rhine quickly realized that they can destroy the nodes
	- The knight can fly! And has 2 actions per turn!
		- It's first move was to summon skeletons that pop out from the bones on the wall
	- Every time they destroy a node, Alexander does a Legendary Action that makes all the skeletons attack (out of turn) whoever destroyed it.
		- If they are out of range, the skeletons attack the closest enemy
	- Aspen rushed to occupy the skeletons at the back of the room
	- Iivana moved to engage the Knight and protect Jimbo and Rhine
		- Rhine got incapacitated, Jimbo used healing magic to wake her up, Jimbo gets knocked out, Rhine uses a medicine check to stabilize Jimbo
	- Qimir did some Rogue shit to destroy some nodes and deal some damage to skeletons
	- Grym ran to the front lines to bail out Aspen, who got knocked out by the Skeleton due to Alexander's legendary action
	- Literally the 2 sorcerers (Nile and Drae) were fighting their own demons at the very back of the fight, taking no damage except those they inflicted on themselves
		- Nile naturally rolled a Wild Magic Surge and rolled a 2 on the wild magic table (has to roll at the start of their next 10 turns)
		- Drae forced Wild Magic Surge using Tides of Chaos
		- infernal butterflies and flumphs and random shit flying around
		- Nile spent 2 turns leaking Grease (spell) all over himself, causing Drae to slip and fall down (but Nile succeeds the saving throw on both occasions)
	- They managed to defeat Alexander and all the skeletons
		- but the head comes flying back!
	- Qimir is the first to notice that the 8th node is hidden on the ceiling (and is not on the floor), causing the resurrection
		- front roll into take out crossbow, aim, fire, shatters the node, killing Alexander
	- [Alexander's Passing](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/6.%20Lore/Recent%20History/Alexander's%20Passing.md) 
	- [Crown of Shadows](Dungeons%20and%20Dragons/8.%20Items/Artifacts%20of%20the%20Shadow%20Queen/Crown%20of%20Shadows.md) appears floating in the middle of the room and calls to the two drows (like the One Ring)
		- Iivana managed to reject it
		- Nile claims the Crown
- Party levels up to 2
