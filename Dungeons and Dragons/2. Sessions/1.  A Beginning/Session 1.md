# Summary
- Introduced each other by describing how they arrived in Reminar's Warehouse
	- everybody literally took a corner of the warehouse to stand and brood like a mysterious hooded figure
- The party obtained a cart from Reminar before setting off
- They encountered a gigantic turtle in a forest, before crossing the plains surrounding Namine Forest
	- reached the edge of the forest just before dark, saw a majestic sunset over the grasslands
- Trail was small and thin and the forest was dark
	- they decided to tie a rope on each other (except for IIvanna who guarded the rear and just held the rope)
- IIvanna saved Nile by warning him about a log that fell nearly on top of him
- Found an abandoned camp near the tomb
- Encountered a curious wolf that IIvana saw on watch during the night
- Entered the Tomb of Alexander and met Namine
	- Gave 10GP and got the Elemental's poem
- Had a scary first encounter with 5 skeletons (which they should have known about from Iivana's Divine Sense)
	- Aspen got knocked twice
	- Nile got friendly fire'd by Drae, consequently leading to his unconsciousness by the skeleton
	- Everybody survived but it was close
- Ended the session with everybody retreating to Namile's fountain and taking a long rest
